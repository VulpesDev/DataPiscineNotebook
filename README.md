## Projects Overview

[**Data Scientist 1**](https://github.com/VulpesDev/DataPiscineNotebook/blob/main/src/DataScientist-1.ipynb)

This project marks the first step of the predictive workflow.
It starts by splitting the data in training and testing sets.
Then it continues with initial data analysis to identify the meaningful features.
In the end it introduces techniques for cleaning and scaling the datasets.

The final stage, focused on building, training and testing various classification ML models.
Implementing and tuning models like Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and a Soft Voting Ensemble.
Rigorous evaluation using metrics like Accuracy, F1-Score, and the Confusion Matrix to ensure robust performance and identify misclassifications.

[**Data analyst**](https://github.com/VulpesDev/DataPiscineNotebook/blob/main/src/DataAnalyst.ipynb)

This foundational project focused on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization.
The goal was to analyze the raw data and determine the most effective ways to display key statistics, distributions, and relationships.

## Context
---

This repository showcases my work completed in the Data Science Piscine at 42Berlin way back in June.

I decided to change the data a bit to make it more engaging and stylish.

Something else I did is the added narrative alongside my notes.

This is a super beginner level Data Science, however it did spark inspiration and it also made me slide in the field with ease.

I plan to explore more interesting projects in this field in the future.
